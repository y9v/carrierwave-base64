Upload files encoded as base64 to carrierwave.

This small gem can be useful for API's that interact with mobile devices.

This gem requires Ruby 2.0 or higher.

## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'carrierwave-base64'
```

Also add this if you need mongoid support:

```ruby
gem "carrierwave-mongoid"
```

## Usage

Mount the uploader to your model:

```ruby
mount_base64_uploader :image, ImageUploader
```

Now you can also upload files by passing an encoded base64 string to the attribute. This also works for normal file uploads from file fields inside an HTML form, so you can safely replace `mount_uploader` with `mount_base64_uploader` to support both file input and base64 encoded input

## Upload file extension

The file extension for the uploaded base64 string is identified automatically using the [mime-types](https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/) gem and `content_type` from the uploaded string.

If the required MIME type is not registered, you can add it, using [MIME::Types#add](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/mime-types/MIME/Types#add-class_method):

```ruby
MIME::Types.add(
  MIME::Type.new('application/icml').tap do |type|
    type.add_extensions 'icml'
  end
)
```

## Setting the file name

You can set the `file_name` option to a lambda, that will return a filename without an extension, using the model instance:

```ruby
mount_base64_uploader :image, ImageUploader, file_name: -> (u) { u.username }
```

If you still want to set the filename to a fixed string, wrap it in a Proc:

```ruby
mount_base64_uploader :image, ImageUploader, file_name: -> { 'userpic' }
```

## Data format

File extention for the uploaded file is identified automatically based on the file contents. If it can't be identified automaticaly, it falls back to the content-type, specified in the data string.

```
data:image/jpeg;base64,(base64 encoded data)
```
